PURPOSE
This program was written for MDP Intelligent Model of the Eye Research Project.
The purpose of this program is to take readings from a pressure sensor attached to a simulator of an eye. 

INITIALIZATION
The program will wait for the user to fill up the simulator to a certain pressure, at which point it will take an average of the previous ten readings and return this value as the base pressure.

USER FEEDBACK
If the user cuts through the membrane of the simulator, the pressure will drop. At this drop, a red LED and a buzzer will turn on.
